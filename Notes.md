I used esp 8285

Some notes on connections

- no external power supply
- reset connected to 3.3 V with no resistor
- GPIO0 is connected to ground; no switch used - just wire jumper (when flashing) . It is not connected in normal using mode.
- flashing config as in the picture below
- Flash tool can be downloaded from - https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools
- Flash setting for ESP8285 is in the picture below but the one that I tried - esp-link was not working.
- don't forget to disconnect GPIO0 after flashing
